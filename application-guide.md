* **Learn from and interact with world-class researchers and engineers** who are there for most of the week.
* **Take the time to focus on learning**. The week long Indaba is an intense programme designed to both teach and reinforce through practical sessions and discussion with peers.
* **Deep-dive into topics of interest**. Our new parallel tracks allow you to tailor your experience to be more theoretical, more applied or more focussed on policy, strategy and ethics.
* **Become part of the community**. We are a fast-growing community of researchers, industry professionals, academics and students from across Africa and the world!

Please see our [provisional programme](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/schedule-2019.html) for more information.

## What does it cost?
Registration is FREE for students. For general attendees there is a fee (please check back for details).

Registration covers participation in lectures and practical sessions, lunch, coffee breaks and evening events. All other costs, including travel and accommodation, are the responsibility of the attendees. We do have financial support for travel and accommodation that students may apply for. 

## Financial Support and Awards
**Applying for financial support will not affect a student’s chances of being accepted to attend the Indaba.**

We will offer financial support to encourage students from across our continent to attend. We will not be able to fund everyone who applies for these awards, so applications are competitive. In 2017 we supported 70 students, in 2018 we supported almost 200 students, and we hope to increase this number in 2019.

## Example Responses
You should answer the questions in any way you like - there is no right or wrong way. We know that some people might like to see examples of responses and so we have included a collection from last year’s applicants below. Note that they should serve as a guide only.

### Tell us why attending the Deep Learning Indaba is important to you?
> “As I’m working on a program which tries to simulate human brain, I need a deep understanding of neural network and machine learning. In my country, we still lack highly qualified specialists in artificial intelligence, so if we really want to learn it, we have to wait for an opportunity like this to fulfill our desire to study it.  And the fact that it will be in an international environment will give me the privilege to create new relationships with people from different cultures with different ideas and perspectives in order to expand my skills in this field. I’m really passionate about machine learning and its applications which can be potential tools for social innovations.” - MSc student

> “I am fascinated by the incredible applications from simple fruit classification to Baidu's success in reuniting an abducted child with his family 27 years after the event. Having dedicated a significant portion of my time out of studies/work to furthering my ML knowledge (Coursera, Udacity, academic papers), I believe this conference will provide an incredible opportunity for me to further my technical ability and understanding of how deep learning can impact the world - for application in business and through my non-profit drive.” - Industry professional

> “The main motivation for attending the Deep Learning Indaba is to improve my skills in deep learning methodologies and also meet industry experts in the field. Astronomy and especially radio astronomy is an area where deep learning methods have a lot of potential applications. With the interactions at the Indaba I intend to bring those expertise available in industry to science. This is very critical when the biggest big data project like Square Kilometer Array is being setup in South Africa.”  - Postdoc

> “For my 3rd year applied mathematics project I designed a neural network for facial recognition. This project gave me a taste of what machine learning is all about and I would really like to expand my knowledge on the subject. The Indaba will also allow me to make a much more informed decision on whether a career in machine learning would be the correct career path for me.” - 4th year student

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Am I eligible for travel sponsorship/funding?
Travel sponsorships are only available to students enrolled at an academic institution (university or coding academy) on the continent of Africa. Registration and attendance of the Indaba is, however, still free for all students from anywhere in the world. 

(Note that funding is limited and unfortunately we cannot guarantee that everyone who applies for travel sponsorship will receive it.)

### Can I apply if I attended last year's Indaba?
Yes! Our aim is to build a community of machine learning researchers in Africa. Continuity is an important part of this. In addition to the community-building and networking benefits, you will also gain exposure to new speakers, more advanced topics in our parallel tracks and updated practical sessions! 

### I already applied for an Indaba X, do I still need to apply here?
The 27 Indaba X events were independent events affiliated with the Deep Learning Indaba. We strongly encourage everyone who attended an Indaba X event to apply for the main Deep Learning Indaba in Nairobi. You will still need to complete the application form described here!
